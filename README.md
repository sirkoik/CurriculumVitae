## Display note 

The .docx displays well in desktop versions of Microsoft Word, but some formatting breaks in web versions.

The PDF version works well in all viewers, but has some slight formatting problems inherited from when I used the web version of Word to edit it. I eventually want to change the format to TeX or something similar.
